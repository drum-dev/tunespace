TuneSpace is a guide that provides biographies, discographies, and lyrics of musicians in all genres pulling data from various databases into one convenient location. By bringing multiple data streams into one centralized hub our goal is to create a communal website where users can explore their favorite artists and discover new music. The site features dynamically updated HTML and CSS with local storage used for search results and other relevant parameters.

# The User Experience
* As a music fan, I want to be able to search for an artist
* I want my search to populate the front page and display biography information, top tracks, and the artist's discography
* When I click on a song from the top track list, I'm sent to a seperate page that displays the genre, track description, and song lyrics
* If available, a link to a YouTube video will also be displayed
* Links to an artist's social media and webpages will be deployed to the bottom of the page if they are available
